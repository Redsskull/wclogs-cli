# Developer Learning Roadmap: Building Tomorrow's Positronic Brains
*Created: September 25, 2025*
*Revised: October 18, 2025*

## The Vision
*"Like Asimov, we seek to understand the universe through the lens of intelligence - both human and artificial. Computers are our expanded consciousness, our way of thinking with machines about the deeper patterns that connect all things. Each project is a step toward building systems that don't just compute, but think, feel, and surprise us with their own intelligence."*

---

## My Core Truth
I'm not here to make things pretty - I'm here to make them **think**. My passion lies deep in the brain of systems, not in their surface appearance. I want to understand how minds work - both human and machine. I build the engines, not the paint jobs.

## Stack Purpose
- **Go** - üß† The Nervous System (fast, concurrent, reliable)
- **Python** - ü§ñ The Learning Center (AI, patterns, decisions)
- **Bash** - üîß The Body (real-world interfaces)
- **Lua** - üé≠ The Personality (behaviors, rules, character)
